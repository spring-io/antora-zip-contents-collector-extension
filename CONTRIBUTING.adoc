= Contributing
This section provides information on how to develop and contribute to the project.

== Prerequisites
To build this project and run the tests, you need the following software installed on your computer:

* {url-git}[git] (command: `git`)
* {url-nodejs}[Node.js] (commands: `node`, `npm`, and `npx`)



== git
First, make sure you have git installed.

[,console]
----
$ git --version
----

If not, {url-git-dl}[download and install] the git package for your system.



== Node.js
Next, make sure that you have Node.js installed (which also provides npm and npx).

[,console]
----
$ node --version
----

If this command fails with an error, you don't have Node.js installed.
If the command doesn't report an {url-nodejs-releases}[active LTS version] of Node.js, it means you don't have a suitable version of Node.js installed.

We strongly recommend that you use {url-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js installation(s).
Follow the {url-nvm-install}[nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.

Once you've installed nvm, open a new terminal and install Node.js 16 using the following command:

[,console]
----
$ nvm install
----

You can switch to this version of Node.js at any time using the following command:

[,console]
----
$ nvm use
----

Now that you have git and Node.js installed, you're ready to start developing on this project.



=== Clone Project
Clone the project using git:

[,console,subs=attributes+]
----
$ git clone {url-project} && cd "`basename $_`"
----

The previous chained command clones the project then switches to the project folder on your filesystem.
Stay in this project folder when running all subsequent commands.



=== Install Dependencies
Use npm to install the project's dependencies inside the project.
In your terminal, run the following command:

[,console]
----
$ npm ci
----

This command installs the dependencies listed in [.path]_package-lock.json_ into the [.path]_node_modules/_ folder inside the project.
This folder should _not_ be committed to the source control repository.



=== Run Tests
This project uses {url-mocha}[mocha] to run the tests and the assertion library {url-chai}[chai] to assert outcomes.
To run the test suite, use:

 $ npm test

By default, `npm test` will run all tests.
You can run the tests in a single test suite by passing the path of that test suite as the final argument:

[,console]
----
$ npm test test/partial-build-extension-test.js
----

You can also run a single test by adding `.only` to the `it` function (e.g., `it.only`).
If `it.only` is present, `npm test` will only run that test.

To generate a coverage report when running the tests (enabled by default in CI), run the `coverage` script instead:

[,console]
----
$ npm run coverage
----

A coverage report shows the lines, statements, and branches that the tests exercise.
You can view the coverage report by opening the HTML file [.path]_reports/lcov-report/index.html_ in your browser.



=== Verify Code Style
This project adheres to the {url-standardjs}[JavaScript Standard style] with some exceptions defined in [.path]_.eslintrc_.
The code style is verified using {url-eslint}[ESLint].

To verify that the style of the code is correct, run the following command:

[,console]
----
$ npm run lint
----

To format the code to adhere to the code style, run the following command:

[,console]
----
$ npm run format
----

The CI workflow will fail if there are pending code style changes, so be sure to run it before you push a change.



=== Use Project From Source
If you want to use the project locally before it is published, you can specify the path to the project as the version in [.path]_package.json_.

[,json]
----
"dependencies": {
  "@springio/antora-extensions": "/path/to/project"
}
----

When you run `npm i` in that project, npm will set up a symlink to the location of this project.
Any changes to this project will take effect immediately.
